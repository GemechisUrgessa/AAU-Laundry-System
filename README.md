# AAU-Laundry-System

The system we aimed to develop is the  AAU laundry system. Most universities in the developed countries serve their students with  a laundry service and here in our university a place for laundry is provided but it's not modern and it doesn't match a first generation university.
This laundry is different from other laundries because it gives service only for AAU students and the service fee is very low. Students used to face a lot of challenges to wash their clothes and they waste a lot of time while waiting till it gets dry. Besides, they used to lose their clothes, they got stolen a number of times. The environment was not suitable for handicapped students too. Our system uses the students ID for authentication service and gives the service for each student by reaching into their dorms. Rather than the payment maid for the laundry itself, the delivery service won't cost them a penny. 

Features:-
 The System will allow sign up of new users to the laundry system 
Users signing up for the system will be verified to ensure that they are student of Addis Ababa University.
 The authentication will be done based on the Student ID and email that is stored on the school database.
 The system will provide a list of cloth categories that are supported by the organization for wash.
 The user can select the type of cloth they want to get washed and select the quantity of the cloth item, then they will immediately be notified the total price amount they would pay.
 The system will provide two options for the users in case of delivering their clothes to the laundry. These are, either by themselves or having it delivered by the delivery personnel of the laundry.
 The system will generate a random code for order ID.
